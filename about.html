    <p id="para">Here at Helix Design, we aim to create unique websites that give your business the personality that it needs to gain traction in the highly competitive world of the internet.
    <br/>
    <br/>Thats why we build each website from the ground up, with your business in mind. We don't like the idea of using cookie cutter website designs that all look the same.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    From humble roots we started our buiness back in 2000, begining with making websites <em>pro bono</em> locally, and today we have coded websites for companies around the world.</p>
